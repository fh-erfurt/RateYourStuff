Project to rate different types of multimedia and share your current progress.


## What is RateYourStuff?
RateYourStuff aims to be a rating-platform for different kinds of media. It is planned to support the following types of media:
- Books
- Movies
- Series
- Games

Users will be able to rate media with different criteria. For each media there will be a general rating which is determined by the rated criteria. Users will be able to share their progress on different types of media. Each media has it's own comment section. According to the progress of each user there will be spoiler-warnings. Furthermore it is also planned to have some sort of media collections to group media logically.
